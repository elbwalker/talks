## SHOW NOTES

Alexander from Elbwalker and I are talking about why tracking implementation is so hard and creates so much frustration on the way, why pure auto-tracking is not the solution, and why context is pure analytics magic.
New tracking setups have a lot of really cool high-energy moments just because it's something new. And often we do a new tracking setup replacing an existing tracking setup that was not so good. And so everyone is super motivated in this to create something new and then comes the implementation.
And implementation usually sucks up any joy and fun of a tracking setup project
Because it's hard to get some resources in the first place and then it takes longer than everyone thought. The developers don't really like to do it. because for them it’s something they don’t do every day. And then things are not implemented in the way that you want to have them implemented. So for me, tracking implementation is still one of the hardest things to do. And Alexander from Elbwalker was so frustrated by this that he started a company to make it better.
