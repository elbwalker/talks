# MeasureCamp Helsinki 2023

[MeasureCamp Helsinki](https://helsinki.measurecamp.org/)

MeasureCamp is an open, free-to-attend unconference, different to any other web analytics conference held around the world.

**Challenge it: one implementation to rule them all?**

Session description:
Setting up analytics can be difficult. I created walker.js to simplify data collection and call it an implementation layer. Always looking for what's missing and how to improve.
